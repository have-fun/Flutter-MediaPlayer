# Media Player

This application allows you to search for songs, show the song information  
(name, artist, album and artwork) and play the preview.

It can run on Android devices with minimum OS version 4.1 (Jelly Bean).

## Getting Started

To build the app, the Flutter SDK is required.

You can build the app by using the IDE (Android Studio, IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code)  
with the Flutter plugin installed, or via the command line:-

    flutter build apk

You can run the app directly inside the IDE, or via the command line:-

    flutter run

To test the app via the command line, type

    flutter test test/**/*_test.dart 

There are two types of tests - widget testing and unit testing.

## TODOs

- Add loading state while waiting for search results
- Improve error reporting with more details
- Auto search after input delay
- Add more test coverage
